# Simple Card — Smart Business Card & Document Scanner

A Flutter-based iOS app for scanning, managing, and sharing business cards and documents with built-in OCR and PDF generation.

## ✨ Features

### 📷 Smart Scanner
- **Full-screen camera** with real-time edge detection overlay
- **Dynamic alignment frame** — automatically tracks and highlights card/document edges using iOS Vision framework (`VNDetectRectanglesRequest`)
- **Auto-classification** — distinguishes business cards from documents based on detected aspect ratio
- **Perspective correction** — applies `CIPerspectiveCorrection` for a flat, clean scan result
- **Confirmation screen** — preview the corrected image before proceeding, with manual type toggle (Card ↔ Document)
- **Single / Continuous** capture modes with swipe or tap to switch
- **Gallery import** — pick existing photos with the same auto-detect pipeline

### 🪪 Business Card OCR
- Powered by **iOS Vision** (`VNRecognizeTextRequest`) — runs entirely on-device
- Automatically extracts: Name, Company, Title, Phone, Email, Address
- **Card Review** screen to verify and edit extracted fields before saving

### 📄 Document to PDF
- Scanned documents are automatically converted to **PDF** via native iOS rendering
- Multi-page support in **Continuous** capture mode — batch scan → merge into one PDF
- Share or save PDFs via the system share sheet

### 🗂️ Card Management
- **Card Holder** — browse all saved business cards in a searchable grid
- **Card Detail** — view full card info with the original scanned image
- **Card Edit** — modify any field after import
- **Import / Export** — scan new cards, import from gallery

### ⚙️ Settings & Tools
### Notion Integration Status

Notion sync is currently disabled in runtime builds. The app validates local card scanning, review, and PDF workflows; Notion integration remains a future/disabled integration until configuration and release privacy review are completed.
- **Tools** — additional utilities for card data management

```

**Native Layer** (`ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`):
- `processImage` — full OCR pipeline
- `detectRectangleLive` — real-time rectangle detection from camera stream (BGRA frames)
- `processCapture` — detect → perspective correct → classify → return processed image
- `generatePdf` — convert image paths to PDF

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK ≥ 3.x
- Xcode ≥ 15 (for iOS builds)
- Physical iOS device recommended (camera features require real hardware)

### Run
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run -d <device_id>
```

### Notes
- **Wireless debugging** on iOS 26+ may be slow; use a USB connection for best performance.
- Native Swift code changes require a **full rebuild** (stop → `flutter run` again); hot restart is not sufficient.
